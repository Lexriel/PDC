(d) (4 points.) Suppose p refers to an n-byte string and I wish it were m bytes instead 
(where m > n). Other than brevity, what is the advantage of saying 
p = (char *) realloc(p, m) instead of 
{ char *q = (char *) malloc(m); 
if (q) { 
memcpy(q, p, n); 
free(p); 
} 
p = q; 
} 
Answer: If there is suï¬ƒcient free space following *p in the heap, realloc simply 
enlarges the string, avoiding the need to copy.
